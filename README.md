# Admin-Dashboard
An admin dashboard project using CSS Grid. This is an ongoing project. There is no functionality to this dashboard, it's just a layout.

Things learned:
1. Making the overall layout is easier compared to flexbox. 

2. Aligning content, especially within cells, would be easier using flexbox, but for the sake of learning grid, all alignment was done with grid.

3. Using browser's developer tools' layout tab for checking grid overlays is incredibly useful.
